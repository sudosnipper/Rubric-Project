Designed and deployed a custom vulnerable machine to simulate real‑world security flaws and practice offensive security techniques. Performed comprehensive vulnerability discovery, including manual enumeration, exploitation, and post‑exploitation analysis. Conducted static code scanning to identify insecure coding patterns and logic weaknesses. Documented all findings in a structured security report containing vulnerability details, impact analysis, and actionable remediation steps. This project demonstrates practical experience in penetration testing methodology, secure code review, and end‑to‑end vulnerability management.
